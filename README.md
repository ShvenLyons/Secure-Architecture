**Secure Architecture for Drone: Packet-level IDS and Lightweight Channel Encryption**

# Abstract

This repository contains several modules for exploring vulnerabilities in the MAVLink protocol, cryptographic efficiency, and intrusion detection at the packet level. 

Do not use the provided code in any real-world environment without proper authorization.

---

## ðŸ“‚ CRC
Code for validating the vulnerability of MAVLinkâ€™s CRC checksum mechanism and demonstrating how a greedy search algorithm can recover the `crc_extra` value.

- **./CRC/CRC_EXTRA.py**  
  Given a raw MAVLink packet, obtain the corresponding `crc_extra` value for its `msgid`.

- **./CRC/Verify.py**  
  Verify the vulnerability by checking CRC correctness using known `crc_extra` together with header and payload.

## ðŸ“‚ Cipher
A lightweight proxy for benchmarking encryption/decryption algorithms by measuring latency and efficiency.

- **./Cipher/main.py**  
  Entry point for starting the proxy.

- **./Cipher/encrypt_utils.py**  
  Provides functions and definitions for each algorithm; serves as the interface between the main execution window and the actual encryption/decryption implementations.

- **./Cipher/...**  
  Remaining code implementing specific cipher algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ ECIDS
Framework for packet-level intrusion detection (IDS), with two classifier head implementations based on Word2Vec embeddings.

- **./ECIDS/word2vec_MLP.py**  
  ECIDS variant using MLP as the classifier head. Allows gradient-based feedback and has room for further improvements.

- **./ECIDS/word2vec_RF.py**  
  ECIDS variant using Random Forest as the classifier head. Achieves the best performance among lightweight classifier comparisons.

## ðŸ“‚ Attack
Contains various UAV attack simulation codes.  
Details are not included here for security considerations.
